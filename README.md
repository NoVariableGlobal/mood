# MOOD

MOOD is a shooter game inspired by [DOOM] and [Dead Ops Arcade].

## Set-Up

There are two ways to set-up, we provide a [PowerShell] script to make things easier, but you can also set up everything
manually if you prefer or if the automated script gives you problems (please open an issue or contact the team if this
happens!).

In advance, we require you to have installed [CMake] and [Visual Studio 2019][VisualStudio2019].

### Automated Set-Up

First of all, you might need to change [PowerShell]'s policy settings to run our script, it is because we provide an
unofficial script, to allow it, you will need to use the [Set-ExecutionPolicy] command, you can safely do the following:

```ps1
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process
```

> The `-Scope Process` sets the execution policy for the [PowerShell]'s session, meaning it will reset to default once
you close the window. If you drop it, `Scope`'s value will be `LocalMachine`, affecting all users of the computer.

To run the script, we will use an existing [PowerShell] window, you can open it by pressing `Shift` and then do right
click anywhere in the project's folder, it will show you some extra options, including `Open PowerShell window here`.
Alternatively, open a new window and `cd` to the project's folder.

Once you have your [PowerShell] window in this project's folder, you can use our interactive utilities script to
simplify the entire set-up:

```ps1
.\scripts\utils.ps1 -Interactive
```

Alternatively, you can run the following command to set up all dependencies and compile the project:

```ps1
.\scripts\build.ps1
```

That's all!

### Manual Set-Up

All the steps will be done with [CMake]'s GUI and [VS2019][VisualStudio2019], you are welcome to use scripts in the
shell of your preference.
